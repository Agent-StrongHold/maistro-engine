       front end on every non-localhost deployment, because the defaults in
       `config.py` only cover localhost.
    2. **No Origin at all.** curl and other non-browser callers send none.
       Origin-based rules only bind browsers; such a caller still needs a valid
       session.
    3. **Explicitly configured**, including the `"*"` wildcard that
       `CORSMiddleware` already honours for HTTP. Not honouring it here would

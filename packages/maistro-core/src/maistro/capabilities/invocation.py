"""Canonical Binding -> Invocation external-effect boundary.

An Invocation is one actual provider call beneath an Attempt. ``effect_key`` is
stable across retries of the same logical NodeRun so recovery can distinguish a
known completed effect from an outcome that is unsafe to repeat.

Generic provider exceptions are deliberately recorded as ``UNKNOWN`` rather
than retryable failure: an exception can arrive after the remote system has
already committed the side effect. A provider/adapter may raise
:class:`EffectNotApplied` only when it can prove no external effect occurred.

"""End-to-end driver for the ``harness_runner`` slot (SPEC-208).

``HarnessSessionManager`` is the glue between the capability slot, the safety
wrapper, and the sequence policy engine — the piece both the outbound graph node
and the inbound ``/v1/harness/sessions`` route build on:

- resolves the active ``harness_runner`` provider from the ``CapabilityRegistry``
  (respecting enable/health/fallback);
- wraps it in :class:`SafeHarnessRunner` — Warden scans every inbound message, and
  when a :class:`SequencePolicyEngine` is supplied a per-session
  :class:`PolicyActionGate` gates every outbound action (cumulative/sequence
  budgets across the whole session);
- when the slot is absent, disabled, or unhealthy it degrades to a typed
  ``Unavailable`` (SAFE_NOOP) — it never raises for a missing harness;
- canonical execution can route a session turn through
  ``Binding -> policy -> Invocation`` without bypassing the existing safety wrapper.

"""Durable canonical Graph execution state.

The canonical :class:`maistro.runs.model.Run` owns lifecycle and scope.
:class:`maistro.graph.execution_state.GraphExecutionState` owns only graph
traversal facts. This package persists the two together with chronological
canonical NodeRuns and Attempts so execution can resume after process loss.

The public durable execution entrypoints cross the canonical physical boundary
through ``Attempt -> AttemptExecutionService -> ExecutionRuntime`` while the
legacy traversal module remains the implementation home for Graph semantics.

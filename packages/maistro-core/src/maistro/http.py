"""Process-wide pooled `httpx.AsyncClient`s, keyed by their configuration.

Why this exists
---------------
Every HTTP call site in the engine used to build its own client per request::

    async with httpx.AsyncClient(timeout=30) as client:
        ...

There were 124 such sites and zero shared clients. Constructing a client is not
cheap — it builds a TLS context, a connection pool and a transport, then throws
all three away — and it guarantees a fresh TCP+TLS handshake on every single
call because there is no pool left to reuse.

Measured, one request:

    per-request client   56.685 ms CPU
    shared client         1.241 ms CPU     46x

The pooling win is separate and larger under load: keep-alive removes the
handshake from the critical path entirely.

Why a keyed cache rather than one module-level client
-----------------------------------------------------
`HttpxAsyncHttp` documented the constraint that made per-request construction
look necessary: an `AsyncClient` binds to the event loop that created it, so a
single module-level client breaks the moment a second loop touches it (tests,
`asyncio.run` in a CLI, a worker with its own loop). The cache is therefore
keyed by the running loop as well as by configuration, so each loop gets its
own pool and the original safety property still holds.

Keying by timeout (rather than sharing one client and overriding per call) keeps
call-site semantics exactly as they were: `timeout=` on an `AsyncClient` is a
*default* for requests that do not specify one, and the call sites rely on that.
Distinct timeouts get distinct pools; connections are reused within each.

Pool size is not admission control
----------------------------------
Do not shrink `max_connections` to throttle load. That was measured directly on
a 300-node DAG competing with 20 interactive requests:

    shared budget, no admission control    chat p50  4.06s
    global cap (max_connections=25)        chat p50 24.14s   <- worst
    priority ordering, no reservation      chat p50  3.51s
    priority + reserved floor for LIVE     chat p50  2.03s

A small global connection cap is the *worst* of the four, because it throttles
everything into one queue and interactive requests wait behind batch work. The
pool's job is connection reuse; admission is `tasks.lanes.LaneGate`'s job.

Size the pool from Little's Law instead: concurrency = throughput x latency. At
50 req/s against 2s calls you need ~100 connections in flight, so a limit below
that turns into an invisible queue.

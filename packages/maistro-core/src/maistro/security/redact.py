"""Secret redaction for logs, prompts, and error messages.

Fixes over the previous implementation:
- Auth-header pattern anchored to actual header context (not bare prose)
- Entropy heuristic catches unknown key formats (fail-closed)
- All match spans collected first, merged, then substituted once
  (no order-dependent overlaps leaving partial fragments)

"""Transactional outbox for canonical event publication.

A caller stages an EventEnvelope on the same SQLite connection and transaction as
its domain-state mutation. Committing that transaction makes both durable; rolling
it back makes neither durable. A separate publisher drains committed outbox rows
to the canonical EventStore. Publication is at-least-once, while stable event IDs
make logical delivery to the canonical store idempotent.

"""Wires real per-call usage into the local quota cache (`InMemoryUsageLog`).

The one thing guaranteed present and correct in every LiteLLM (OpenAI-
compatible) response is the standard `usage.prompt_tokens` /
`usage.completion_tokens` pair — that's part of the compatibility contract
itself, so it's populated the same way regardless of which upstream provider
actually served the call. This is therefore the *primary* recording path.

Provider-specific extras (raw rate-limit headers, Cohere's `meta.billed_units`)
are not guaranteed to survive LiteLLM's response normalization the way the
standard `usage` object is — a proxy whose whole job is presenting one common
shape has no obligation to forward provider-native metadata untouched. Ambient
header parsing (`ambient.py`) is wired in here too, but strictly as a
best-effort bonus signal: if the expected headers didn't survive the proxy
hop, the parser already returns an empty list and nothing happens — the
primary `usage`-based recording is what a caller should actually rely on.

"""Well-known domains (Project.use_case values) shipped with maistro.

This is intentionally NOT an enum — `use_case` stays a free string on the
Project record so users + ops can mint their own (a brand team
could create `use_case='brand_compliance'` without a code change). The
list below is the curated set the standard frontends recognize and ship
a default page set + nav config for. Anything else falls back to the
"generic" shell.

The User → Domain → many Projects hierarchy is enforced by the store +
the frontend mount paths, not by this enum.

#                         (image-gen + composite + Lulu print-on-demand) is
#                         already nearly complete; ship it as the second
#                         frontend to prove the DAG executor handles non-
#                         text domains end-to-end.
#   3. engineering_rfc  — token seat; full UI deferred to v0.4.
#   4-6. support_triage, marketing_campaign, product_discovery — token
#         seats; curated configs ship now so external integrations can
#         declare which domain they target, but no dedicated UI yet.

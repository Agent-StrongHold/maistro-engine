        *system* prompt. Filtering matters here more than in a normal read path
        because a learning is an instruction, not a datum.

        Org matching is exact: `org_id` matches only rows carrying that same
        `org_id`, and an empty `org_id` matches only rows that have none. There
        is deliberately no global bucket. An earlier form of this predicate
        also admitted `org_id = ''` rows to every caller, mirroring the
        `agent_id = ''` convention on the line below, but the two are not
        analogous — `agent_id = ''` widens within one org, while `org_id = ''`
        crosses the tenancy boundary that SPEC-216 names a non-goal ("cross-org
        learning sharing of any kind"). Any write path that failed to set
        `org_id` silently published into that bucket, and a learning is an
        instruction interpolated into the system prompt, not a datum.

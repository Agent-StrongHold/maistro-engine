"""Build the GitHub release body from CHANGELOG.md (E3, #296).

The release plan specifies the body as "CHANGELOG section + the ADR-076 API
statement". The curated `## [X.Y.Z]` section written for E4 already carries an
`### API compatibility` block, so this script *extracts* that section and only
appends the canonical statement when the section does not already contain one —
appending unconditionally would print the API stance twice on every release,
which is exactly the kind of thing nobody notices until a user does.

A release candidate gets an extra banner at the top: it publishes the same
notes as the final release it is a candidate for (the section is keyed on the
base version), and a reader landing on a `-rcN` release needs to know that
before they read notes written in the present tense.

Usage
-----
    scripts/release_notes.py --tag v1.0.0-rc1 --version 1.0.0 --output notes.md

`--version` is the base version the guard already resolved; passing it rather
than re-deriving it keeps one parser for the tag grammar.

**The stable HTTP surface in this release is the `/v1` route mount.** Clients
should address `/v1/...` paths directly.

[ADR-076](docs/adr/ADR-076-http-api-versioning.md) specifies version selection
by **content negotiation** (`Accept: application/vnd.maistro.vN+json`). **That
scheme is not implemented** in this release — do not write clients against it.

The API version axis is independent of the package version: a `1.x` package
release does not imply a `/v2` HTTP surface.

## Verifying this release

**Artifacts.** Wheels and sdists for `maistro-core`, `maistro-canvas`,
`maistro-evolve`, `maistro-rsi` and `maistro-bootstrap`; `SHA256SUMS` over all
of them plus the installers; CycloneDX SBOMs (syft) for the source tree and
both container images; and the `get.sh` / `get.ps1` / `install.sh` installers.

**Checksums.**

```bash
sha256sum --check --ignore-missing SHA256SUMS
```

**Container images.** Published to `ghcr.io` and signed keylessly with cosign
(no long-lived key; the signature is bound to this workflow and this tag):

```bash
cosign verify \\
  --certificate-identity-regexp \\
    '^https://github.com/Agent-StrongHold/maistro-engine/\\.github/workflows/release\\.yml@refs/tags/{re.escape(tag)}$' \\
  --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \\
  ghcr.io/agent-stronghold/maistro-engine:{tag}
```

**Provenance.** The tag is annotated and, per
[ADR-073126-c4e1]({REPO_URL}/blob/{tag}/docs/adr/ADR-073126-c4e1-release-and-versioning-process.md),
points at a commit on `main` (or `integration` for a release candidate).
`release.yml` is the only path that publishes these artifacts."""

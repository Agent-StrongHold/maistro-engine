# Backlog

Companion to [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md). Items are tagged by the part of the product they belong to:

- `engine-NNN` — shared substrate (runtime, ADRs, templates, registry)
- `conductor-NNN` — Conductor variant (single-tenant multi-user)
- `turing-NNN` — autonoetic variant
- `sh-NNN` — multi-tenant variant (Stronghold)

Maintained per [`engine#ADR-019`](docs/adr/ADR-019-canonical-source-split.md). Status follows [`engine#ADR-031`](https://github.com/BlakeMatthews-dev/maistro-engine/blob/main/docs/adr/ADR-031-front-matter-and-registry.md) lifecycle. External-library adoption per [`engine#ADR-039`](https://github.com/BlakeMatthews-dev/maistro-engine/blob/main/docs/adr/ADR-039-external-library-adoption-policy.md).

## Status legend

| Marker | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Proposed | Open for discussion; not yet binding |
| Accepted | Decision binding; implementation may follow |
| Implemented | Decision shipped; production code matches |
| Superseded | Replaced by a successor (named in `supersedes:` of successor) |
| Blocked | A `blocked-by:` dependency is unmet |
| Abandoned | Decision deliberately not taken (kept for traceability) |

**Obsolete** — the item tracked work against specs that lived in the pre-consolidation sibling repositories. Those specs are not part of this repo, so the item can no longer be actioned or verified here.

## Gap legend

| Marker | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `gap-spec` | No spec or ADR captures this decision yet |
| `gap-test` | Spec/ADR exists; no test (or test stub) covers it |
| `gap-impl` | Spec/ADR + test exist; production code does not match |

**[engine-083] Disaster-recovery / backup-restore primitives — Proposed**

**[engine-084] Chaos-engineering harness — Proposed**

**[engine-085] Trace export to long-term storage — Proposed**

### Hive Conductor distribution & frontend (migrated from archived `cutover/MASTER-PLAN.md` + `design/PRODUCT-SPEC.md`)

**[engine-100] Hosted curl installer + web wizard — Proposed**
- `get.hiveconductor.com/install.sh` and `install.hiveconductor.com` web wizard never built
- Local `get.sh`/`install.sh` cover a manual-clone install path; the hosted one-liner distribution does not exist

**[engine-101] GHCR image publishing pipeline — Implemented — Proposed; `gap-impl`**
- Cross-check `packages/hive-conductor/frontend/src` against the archived 10-page spec; several shared components exist (`AppShell.tsx`, `AgentFleetCard.tsx`, `WidgetMicroChat.tsx`) but full page coverage (Missions, Schedules, Skills marketplace, MCP discovery, CLI terminal, Container Builder, Memory Explorer) is unverified/incomplete

**[engine-103] MCP server implementations — Proposed**
- `mcp-sandbox`, `mcp-git`, `mcp-browser`, `mcp-ha`, `mcp-utils`, `mcp-trading`, `mcp-reminders` were planned as standalone MCP servers; core already has overlapping in-process tools (`tools/sandbox`, `tools/git`, `tools/browser`) — decide wrap-existing vs. build-new before scoping

**[engine-104] Port remaining legacy experimental features — Proposed**
- Shipped: Bouncer, Agent Factory, Spawner, Skill Forge, Message Board. Superseded: Heartbeat (replaced by `reactor.py`). Outstanding: APM, Red Team — feature-flagged off, not yet ported into the consolidated monorepo

**[engine-105] Wire Master Orchestrator security gate + API dispatch — Accepted; `gap-impl`**
- `orchestrator/master.py` + `orchestrator/planner.py` exist (Group J1–J4 done), but the Security Scanner gate (J5) and wiring into the `maistro-server` API (J6) from the archived consolidation plan are still open

### NEW — from May 2026 catalog review (engine)

**[engine-090] Chat-UI integration contract — Proposed; `gap-impl` — v1.1**
- OpenAI-compatible chat completions (LiteLLM gateway already exposes) **+ A2UI for rich UI generation + MCP for tools**
- Substrate: `BlakeMatthews-dev/A2UI` (Apache 2.0, v0.8 preview) — see INSPIRATIONS.md "Adjacent products"
- Tested against OWUI, LibreChat, Lobe Chat as render targets
- Defuses Open WebUI 50-user attribution clause for stronghold tenants by allowing alternative UI per tenant

**[engine-091] A2UI version-pin substrate confirmation — Proposed — v1.1**
- Pin A2UI to a specific tag in engine's Copier templates (`[engine-010/011/012]`)
- Substrate: `BlakeMatthews-dev/A2UI`

**[engine-092] CLI-Anything skills bundle — Proposed; `gap-impl` — v1.1**
- Adopt 35+ HKUDS/CLI-Anything pre-generated harnesses (GIMP, Blender, LibreOffice, OBS, etc.) as engine skills with manifests + sandbox profiles
- Apache 2.0; service-boundary (subprocess) per `engine#ADR-039`
- Substrate: `engine#ADR-006` (recipe-registry), `engine#ADR-035` (catalog split)

**[engine-093] Self-CLI generation — Proposed — v1.2**
- Run CLI-Anything against our own packages: produce `maistro-cli`, `turing-cli`, `stronghold-cli`, `engine-cli`
- Pattern reference: `Khamel83/oneshot` `bin/oneshot` CLI-first surface
- Replaces ad-hoc admin scripts; agents and operators share the same surface

**[engine-094] MCP server registry survey + catalog seed — Proposed — v1.0 M3**
- Periodic survey of `punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers` for new candidates passing the maintainer-signal gate (`engine#ADR-039` §3)
- Tier 1 (vendor-official: Microsoft, AWS, HashiCorp, LocalStack) and Tier 2 (org-backed) populate the engine simple catalog
- Stronghold's multi-tenant catalog (`[sh-001]`) inherits the same baseline

**[engine-095] Default skills bundle — Proposed; `gap-impl` — v1.0 M3**
- Standard CLI tools wrapped as versioned skills with manifests, sandbox profiles, and policy bindings
- Categories: search (rg, fd, fzf), data (jq, yq, dasel), HTTP (curl, httpie), git (gh, lazygit), files (yazi, dust, eza), k8s (kubectl, k9s), containers (docker, podman, lazydocker), DBs (pgcli, redis-cli)
- Seeds `engine#ADR-035` simple catalog for mAIstro and Turing; multi-tenant variant for stronghold

**[engine-096] Tournament training-data labeling pipeline — Proposed; `gap-spec` — v1.2**
- Produces (agent_a_output, agent_b_output, intent, verdict) triples at scale for tournament evolution
- Pattern reference: Adala (data-labeling agents)
- Engine-side substrate for `[sh-102]` and `[turing-062]` tournament evolution

**[engine-097] Hyperagent graph runtime substrate — Implemented — v1.2**
- Graph execution primitive (was implicit in `[conductor-200]` hyperagent-graph-runtime); promote to engine substrate
- Single substrate consumed by mAIstro low-code designer and stronghold multi-tenant low-code surface

**[engine-098] Memory drift detection — Proposed; `gap-spec` — v1.1**
- Detect retrieval-quality degradation independent of decay (`engine#ADR-013`)
- Pattern reference: `compemperor/engram` drift-detection
- Engine-side; products inherit

**[engine-099] Recency-summarizer skills + description-optimizer — Proposed; `gap-impl` — v1.1**
- `recency-summary` + `restore-context` personal skills (recency bands + topic summaries + forward-looking block + `low/med/high` fidelity + source citations); prototype the SPEC-189 context-engine methodology
- TODO: run the skill-creator **description-optimizer** to tune triggering (generate ~20 trigger-eval queries → `run_loop`)
- Native home / substrate: `engine#SPEC-189` (lossless rolling context assembly)

### Discovered gaps (engine — found via exploratory/adversarial testing, June 2026)

**[engine-110] `ServiceKeyRegistry` stale-key mapping + unguarded YAML parsing — Implemented**
- Found while adversarially fuzzing `auth/registry.py` for `engine#SPEC-062826-1924`: re-registering a
  service with a rotated key left the old key live in `_key_to_name`; malformed YAML / a non-mapping
  `services` value raised uncaught instead of degrading like `discover_into`
- Fixed in the same change (`_register_key()` helper; `isinstance` guards + `try/except yaml.YAMLError`
  in `load_yaml`); regression-locked by `formal/models/test_auth_registry.py`
- Session log: `docs/exploratory-sessions/2026-06-28-service-key-registry-backfill.md`

**[engine-111] `AuthMiddleware` sibling-prefix bypass + substring permission carve-out — Implemented**
- Found while building the adversarial path-matching suite for `hive-conductor/backend/middleware/auth.py`
  (`engine#SPEC-062826-1924`): `_PUBLIC_PREFIXES`'s unguarded `startswith` let a sibling of
  `/v1/auth/login`/`/v1/auth/register` bypass auth entirely; `_required_permission`'s `"/invoke" in path`
  was a fail-open substring-anywhere check instead of a trailing-segment check
- Fixed in the same change (`_matches_public_prefix()` boundary helper + `_PUBLIC_EXACT` move;
  `path.endswith("/invoke")`); regression-locked by
  `packages/hive-conductor/backend/tests/test_auth_middleware.py`
- Session log: `docs/exploratory-sessions/2026-06-28-auth-middleware-backfill.md`

## Maintenance

- This file is **identical across all four repos**. Any edit lands in all four.
- IDs are stable. Items never get renumbered.
- When an item is shipped, mark `Implemented` and link the PR.
- When an item is no longer relevant, mark `Abandoned` with a one-line reason. Don't delete.
- Once `engine-001` (registry CI) ships, this BACKLOG is regenerated from front-matter; hand-edits then fail CI.
- Per-product `ROADMAP-v1.0.md` files contain v1.0 acceptance test detail (workstreams, property-test contracts) that doesn't duplicate here.
- External-library decisions (which to import, which to service-boundary, which to pattern-reference, which to reject) follow `engine#ADR-039`.

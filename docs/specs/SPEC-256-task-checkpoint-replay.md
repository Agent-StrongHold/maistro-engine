# SPEC-256: Task crash recovery — checkpoint replay and crash-loop quarantine core

## Context

ADR-056 requires the conductor to resume a long-running task from a durable checkpoint stream
after a crash, demoting waves whose state has drifted and quarantining tasks that crash-loop. No
`TaskCheckpoint` type or replay logic exists today. This SPEC scopes the pure, store-agnostic
core: given an ordered checkpoint sequence, compute the resulting task state (open tool calls,
wave statuses, last-answered approval, cumulative spend) a resume operation would pick up from —
and the crash-loop quarantine decision, reusing `maistro.agents.circuit_breaker.CircuitBreaker`
exactly as ADR-056 directs ("matches ADR-038 defaults") rather than reimplementing it.

## Goals

- Add `maistro/tasks/checkpoint.py`: `CheckpointKind` (`StrEnum`: `TOOL_CALL_ABOUT_TO_FIRE`,
  `TOOL_CALL_DONE`, `WAVE_FAN_OUT`, `WAVE_COMPLETED`, `WAVE_FAILED`, `APPROVAL_GATE_RAISED`,
  `APPROVAL_GATE_ANSWERED`, `SPEND_UPDATE`, `MEMORY_PROMOTE`), `TaskCheckpoint` (frozen
  dataclass: `task_id: str`, `sequence: int`, `kind: CheckpointKind`, `payload: dict[str, Any]`,
  `recipe_version: str`, `code_registry_version: str`, `created_at: datetime`).
- Add `maistro/tasks/replay.py`: `ResumeState` (frozen dataclass: `open_tool_calls:
  frozenset[str]`, `wave_status: dict[str, str]`, `cumulative_spend: float`,
  `pending_approval_gates: frozenset[str]`) and `replay(checkpoints: tuple[TaskCheckpoint, ...])
  -> ResumeState` — a pure left-fold over `checkpoints` sorted by `sequence`:
  - `TOOL_CALL_ABOUT_TO_FIRE{call_id}` adds `call_id` to `open_tool_calls`;
    `TOOL_CALL_DONE{call_id}` removes it. A `call_id` left in `open_tool_calls` at the end of
    the fold is exactly the "mid-flight on crash" set ADR-056 routes through the layered
    recovery contract (idempotency key / verify_side_effect / bubble-up — all out of scope here,
    see Non-goals; this function only identifies *which* calls need that routing).
  - `WAVE_FAN_OUT{wave_id}` sets `wave_status[wave_id] = "running"`; `WAVE_COMPLETED{wave_id}`
    sets `"completed"`; `WAVE_FAILED{wave_id}` sets `"failed"`.
  - `APPROVAL_GATE_RAISED{gate_id}` adds `gate_id` to `pending_approval_gates`;
    `APPROVAL_GATE_ANSWERED{gate_id}` removes it (per ADR-056's open-question resolution: "resume
    replays the answer and continues" — a gate answered just before crash is not left pending).
  - `SPEND_UPDATE{delta}` accumulates into `cumulative_spend` (additive; resumed task starts at
    the pre-crash total per ADR-056's acceptance criteria).
  - `MEMORY_PROMOTE` checkpoints are accepted (kind recognized, payload validated by shape only)
    but produce no `ResumeState` field in this SPEC's scope — memory-side replay is
    `maistro.memory`'s concern, not the task-resume state machine (see Non-goals).
- Add `maistro/tasks/recovery.py`: `CrashLoopPolicy` wrapping a `CircuitBreaker` —
  `record_crash(breaker: CircuitBreaker) -> None` calls `breaker.record_failure()`;
  `should_quarantine(breaker: CircuitBreaker) -> bool` returns `not breaker.allow_request()`.
  Construct the breaker with ADR-038/ADR-056's stated defaults (`failure_threshold=5`,
  `recovery_timeout=60`) at the call site — this module does not hardcode a singleton, consistent
  with `CircuitBreaker` being a per-resource instance elsewhere in the codebase.
- Add a version-drift check: `version_compatible(checkpoint: TaskCheckpoint, *,
  current_recipe_version: str, current_code_registry_version: str) -> bool` — returns `False` if
  either version differs from the checkpoint's recorded version, per ADR-056's "cross-version
  task resume refused with explicit error" acceptance criterion (this function makes the boolean
  decision; raising/surfacing the explicit error is the resume call site's job).

## Non-goals

- `TaskRecovery` Protocol's `resumable_tasks()`/`resume()`/`quarantine()` orchestration —
  database queries, actually re-issuing tool calls, and the `/v1/tasks/{id}/recovery` route are
  follow-up once a persistence layer for `task_checkpoints` exists (ADR-018 extension).
  `replay()` is the pure function that orchestration layer will call.
- The layered idempotency-key / verify_side_effect / bubble-up routing for mid-flight irreversible
  calls (ADR-056 layer 1) — this SPEC identifies the `open_tool_calls` set; routing each one
  through ADR-050's registered capabilities is a separate integration once SPEC-252's registry
  and a real tool-dispatch call site are wired together.
- Shadow-git branch-SHA verification for completed waves (ADR-056 layer 2's drift check against
  SPEC-254/255) — `wave_status` here only tracks the checkpoint-log-derived status string;
  comparing it against the actual shadow-git branch HEAD is a follow-up once a resume call site
  has both the checkpoint state and a live `ShadowGitWorkspace` to compare against.
- `task.resume.{started,completed,quarantined}` events (ADR-037 wiring) — follow-up.
- Hypothesis property test claimed by ADR-056 ("any valid checkpoint sequence yields a consistent
  task state") is included here (see Acceptance criteria) using a generated-checkpoint-sequence
  strategy restricted to well-formed `about_to_fire`/`done` and `raised`/`answered` pairing.
- `task_checkpoints` table schema / persistence — in-memory tuples only in this SPEC.

## Decision

```python
# maistro/tasks/checkpoint.py
class CheckpointKind(StrEnum):
    TOOL_CALL_ABOUT_TO_FIRE = "tool_call.about_to_fire"
    TOOL_CALL_DONE = "tool_call.done"
    WAVE_FAN_OUT = "wave.fan_out"
    WAVE_COMPLETED = "wave.completed"
    WAVE_FAILED = "wave.failed"
    APPROVAL_GATE_RAISED = "approval.gate.raised"
    APPROVAL_GATE_ANSWERED = "approval.gate.answered"
    SPEND_UPDATE = "spend.update"
    MEMORY_PROMOTE = "memory.promote"

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TaskCheckpoint:
    task_id: str
    sequence: int
    kind: CheckpointKind
    payload: dict[str, Any]
    recipe_version: str
    code_registry_version: str
    created_at: datetime

# maistro/tasks/replay.py
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class ResumeState:
    open_tool_calls: frozenset[str]
    wave_status: dict[str, str]
    cumulative_spend: float
    pending_approval_gates: frozenset[str]

def replay(checkpoints: tuple[TaskCheckpoint, ...]) -> ResumeState: ...

# maistro/tasks/recovery.py
class CrashLoopPolicy:
    def record_crash(self, breaker: CircuitBreaker) -> None: ...
    def should_quarantine(self, breaker: CircuitBreaker) -> bool: ...

def version_compatible(checkpoint, *, current_recipe_version, current_code_registry_version) -> bool: ...
```

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] A `TOOL_CALL_ABOUT_TO_FIRE` with a matching later `TOOL_CALL_DONE` leaves that call out of
      `open_tool_calls`; one with no matching `done` leaves it in.
- [x] `WAVE_FAN_OUT` → `WAVE_COMPLETED` for a wave yields `wave_status[wave_id] == "completed"`;
      `WAVE_FAN_OUT` alone (no terminal event) yields `"running"`.
- [x] An `APPROVAL_GATE_RAISED` immediately followed by `APPROVAL_GATE_ANSWERED` (even at the very
      end of the sequence) leaves that gate out of `pending_approval_gates`.
- [x] `SPEND_UPDATE` checkpoints accumulate additively; resumed `cumulative_spend` equals the sum
      of all deltas regardless of how many updates occurred.
- [x] `replay(())` (empty sequence) returns a `ResumeState` with all-empty/zero fields.
- [x] Checkpoints out of `sequence` order in the input tuple are replayed in `sequence` order, not
      input order.
- [x] `CrashLoopPolicy.should_quarantine` is `False` until 5 crashes are recorded, then `True`
      (matching `CircuitBreaker(failure_threshold=5)`'s existing semantics — this SPEC adds no new
      threshold logic, just names the call pattern ADR-056 specifies).
- [x] `version_compatible` returns `False` if either `recipe_version` or `code_registry_version`
      differs from the checkpoint's recorded values; `True` if both match.
- [x] Property test (Hypothesis): for any well-formed sequence of paired
      `about_to_fire`/`done` and `raised`/`answered` events (each pairing same-id, `done`/
      `answered` always at a `sequence` after its opener), `replay()` never leaves a *closed* pair
      in the open set.

## Testing

- `packages/maistro-core/tests/tasks/test_checkpoint_replay.py` (new) — replay-fold matrix above,
  out-of-order sequencing, `CrashLoopPolicy` threshold reuse of the existing `CircuitBreaker`,
  `version_compatible` matrix, and the Hypothesis property test.

## Open questions

- Whether `MEMORY_PROMOTE` checkpoints should feed a `ResumeState` field once `maistro.memory`
  has a replay consumer — deferred; accepting and validating the kind now means no checkpoint
  schema migration is needed when that consumer exists.

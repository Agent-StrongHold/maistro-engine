# SPEC-206: Policy-conformance comparison engine

**Implements:** ADR-074 (Policy ⇄ ADR Deconfliction). ADR-074 decides *what to do on conflict*; this
spec defines *how a conflict is detected* — the comparison engine and its precedence walk.

---

## Problem

ADR-074 requires that a candidate policy decision be compared against authorities in strict precedence
(ADRs → Specs → prior policy) before it can commit (the Repertoire *Rehearse* gate, ADR-070). That
requires a concrete engine: how each layer's invariants are represented, how "conflict" is computed
per layer, and how the result routes into ADR-074's three outcomes.

## Decision

### Authorities carry machine-checkable invariants

For the engine to compare against an ADR or Spec, the authority must expose **checkable assertions**,
not just prose. Extend the registry front-matter (ADR-031/032) with an optional `invariants:` block:

```yaml
# in an ADR/Spec front-matter
invariants:
  - id: INV-068-budget-veto
    safety_critical: true
    assert: "no policy permits a tool call whose cumulative_spend would exceed the task budget"
    check: "code-registry-ref:policy.checks.budget_veto@v1"   # ADR-069 ref, microVM-run
```

- `safety_critical: true` marks an invariant ADR-074 treats as near-inviolable (drift → security review).
- `check` is a **code-registry ref** (ADR-069) — a verifier run in a microVM that returns
  `{satisfied: bool, witness?}` for a candidate policy. Prose-only invariants (no `check`) are
  flagged for human review rather than auto-checked.

### The precedence walk

```python
class Authority(StrEnum):
    ADR = "adr"; SPEC = "spec"; PRIOR_POLICY = "prior_policy"

class ConformanceVerdict(BaseModel):
    ok: bool
    conflict_layer: Authority | None          # first layer that conflicted (None if ok)
    conflict_ref: str | None                   # e.g. "maistro-engine#ADR-068 / INV-068-budget-veto"
    safety_critical: bool = False
    artifacts: list[str] = []                  # N deployed artifacts also in conflict
    evidence: dict                             # the learning's rationale (for the impact analysis)

class ConformanceEngine(Protocol):
    async def check(self, candidate: PolicyDecision) -> ConformanceVerdict: ...
```

`check()` walks **in order, stopping at the first conflict**:

1. **ADRs** — evaluate every relevant ADR invariant whose `check` ref applies to `candidate`.
   Conflict → return with `conflict_layer=ADR`, `safety_critical` from the invariant. (Stop.)
2. **Specs** — same, over Spec invariants. Conflict → `conflict_layer=SPEC`. (Stop.)
3. **Prior policy** — query the policy/audit store (ADR-073 DB, the decision log) for prior decisions
   on the same `(action, scope)` that the candidate would reverse. Conflict → `conflict_layer=
   PRIOR_POLICY` with the superseded precedent in `conflict_ref`. (Stop.)

Relevance is by **scope + action class** (an invariant/precedent applies if its subject overlaps the
candidate's `(action, for-scope, reversibility)`), so the engine checks a bounded set, not the whole
corpus.

### Routing into ADR-074 outcomes

- `ok == true` → the candidate passes Rehearse → **Compose/commit** (ADR-070).
- `conflict_layer != None` → **held**; hand the verdict (layer, ref, artifacts, evidence) to the
  ADR-074 admin review. If `safety_critical` → route to the **security** review path (default revert).

### Artifact blast-radius

When a conflict is found, the engine also resolves the **N deployed artifacts** that depend on the
conflicting authority (recipes citing the ADR via `substrate:`, active policies, code-registry refs),
so the "amend + reconcile" outcome has the exact list to update. This reuses the registry's existing
cross-ref graph (ADR-031).

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] `check()` walks ADR → Spec → prior-policy and **returns on the first conflict** (property test:
      a candidate conflicting with both an ADR and a Spec reports `conflict_layer=ADR`).
- [x] An invariant with `safety_critical: true` sets the verdict flag, routing ADR-074 to security review.
- [x] Invariant `check` refs execute as a checker callable; an unresolved (`checker=None`, prose-only)
      invariant fails closed (treated as conflict pending review). The ADR-069 code-registry/microVM
      execution of that callable is the caller's concern — see Out of scope.
- [x] Prose-only invariants (no `check`) are surfaced for human review, never silently passed.
- [x] Relevance filtering bounds the check to invariants/precedents overlapping the candidate's
      `(action, scope, reversibility)`.
- [x] A conflict verdict includes the N deployed artifacts depending on the conflicting authority, via
      the injected `ArtifactResolver` extension point. The real ADR-031 cross-ref graph implementation
      of that resolver is a follow-up wiring task — see Out of scope.
- [x] `ok` candidates pass to the ADR-070 Compose/commit path; conflicting ones are held.
- [x] Every `check()` result is available to the caller for ADR-037 `policy.decision` audit emission;
      the engine itself does not own event-bus wiring — see Out of scope.

## Out of scope

- The admin-review UI / workflow — product surface (ADR-074 defines the outcomes).
- Authoring the invariant `check` verifiers themselves — per-ADR, code-registry entries. This SPEC's
  `Invariant.checker` is the extension point a real ADR-069 microVM-executed verifier plugs into.
- Backfilling `invariants:` onto existing ADRs — incremental; this spec defines the mechanism, not the
  migration. Safety-critical ADRs (ADR-072/028/068) get invariants first.
- The real `ArtifactResolver` walk over the ADR-031 registry cross-ref graph — this SPEC ships the
  `ArtifactResolver` protocol and a `NoopArtifactResolver`; wiring it to the registry is a follow-up.
- Emitting `policy.decision` / `security.violation` ADR-037 events from `check()` results — the engine
  returns a `ConformanceVerdict` the caller logs; event-bus wiring is the caller's concern.
- The real `PriorPolicyStore` backed by the ADR-073 policy/audit DB — this SPEC ships the protocol;
  callers inject their own store implementation.

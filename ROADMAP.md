# Roadmap

One product in one monorepo. The shared substrate and every variant live here
together: a variant is a Copier template plus the packages it turns on, not a
separate repository. [`BACKLOG.md`](BACKLOG.md) is the item-level companion; the
substrate-vs-variant split is [`engine#ADR-019`](docs/adr/ADR-019-canonical-source-split.md).

## Item ID convention (per [`engine#ADR-031`](docs/adr/ADR-031-front-matter-and-registry.md))

Every roadmap and backlog item is tagged by the part of the product it belongs to:

| Prefix | Part | Concern |
|---|---|---|
| `engine-NNN` | Substrate | Shared runtime, canonical ADRs, Copier templates, registry CI |
| `conductor-NNN` | Conductor variant | Single-tenant multi-user self-hosting (`packages/hive-conductor`) |
| `turing-NNN` | Autonoetic variant | Continuity of self (`packages/maistro-turing`) |
| `sh-NNN` | Multi-tenant variant | Compliance + hard isolation (Stronghold, planned downstream) |

| Part | Role | Dominant constraint |
|---|---|---|
| Substrate | Shared runtime, canonical ADRs, Copier templates, registry CI | n/a (it is the substrate) |
| Conductor variant | Single-tenant secure multi-user deployment | **Ease of self-hosting** |
| Autonoetic variant | Continuity-of-self extensions | **Continuity of self** |
| Multi-tenant variant | Enterprise deployment (planned downstream) | **Multi-tenant isolation** |

## Horizons

- **v1.0** — 3 months. Each variant reaches its MVP; substrate code parity reached.
- **v1.1–1.3** — 3–12 months. Hardening and inventory drainage.
- **v2.0** — 12 months. Inventory-clear: every accepted ADR/spec is `Implemented`, `Superseded`, or `Abandoned`.

---

## v1.0 (3 months) — organised by phase

Phases A–D run sequentially-ish in the substrate. Phase E (per-variant v1.0) runs in parallel from week 1, gated by the substrate items it depends on. Phase F (contracts as the bar) ramps from week 6.

### Phase A — Foundation enforcement (weeks 1–4)

| Item | Part | Status | Detail |
|---|---|---|---|
| `[engine-001]` Registry CI tooling | substrate | Implemented | Front-matter validator + cross-repo link checker + registry generator + GitHub Action; warn-only → hard fail at day 30 |
| `[engine-002]` INVENTORY auto-regenerated | substrate | Proposed | Once `engine-001` lands, hand-edits to INVENTORY fail CI |
| `[engine-003]` Front-matter on existing engine ADRs | substrate | Implemented | ADRs 000–029 gain front-matter on touch (not bulk) |
| `[engine-004]` CONTRIBUTING.md and convention docs | substrate | Implemented | Author-facing summary of ADR-031/032/001 |
| `[turing-090]` Front-matter on Turing specs | autonoetic | Obsolete | 22 top-level + ~70 nested epic stories |
| `[sh-090]` Front-matter on Stronghold specs | multi-tenant | Proposed; warn-only | Mirror of Turing's spec set during transition; will diverge post-Copier |
| `[conductor-090]` Front-matter on mAIstro specs | conductor | Obsolete | 91 specs (`S-NNN` → `SPEC-NNN` on touch) |

### Phase B — Templates bootstrapped (weeks 2–6)

## Maintenance

- Items get appended; status changes happen in-place. IDs are stable; never renumbered.
- Once `engine-001` (registry CI) ships, ROADMAP and BACKLOG are regenerated from front-matter; hand-edits then fail CI.

"""Gate: production code must not build a per-request `httpx.AsyncClient`.

Constructing a client builds a TLS context, a connection pool and a transport,
then throws all three away — 56.685ms of CPU per request against 1.241ms for a
pooled one, plus a fresh TCP+TLS handshake with no pool left to reuse.
`maistro.http.shared_client` exists so a call site gets pooling with a one-line
change.

## Why a gate rather than a one-time sweep

The migration that introduced `shared_client` was driven by a regex over
`async with httpx.AsyncClient(...) as client:`, and it missed every site
written in the parenthesized multi-line form:

    async with (
        httpx.AsyncClient(timeout=120.0) as client,
        client.stream("POST", url, json=payload) as r,
    ):

Three survived — both streaming paths in `adapters/llm_http.py` and the
chat-completions call in `services/graph_runner.py`. All three are LLM calls,
which is to say the hottest path in the application and precisely what the
change existed to fix. `llm_http.py` already imported `shared_client` for its
*other* sites, so the file looked migrated from every angle except this one.

Grepping does not catch it either: the module imports the helper, uses it, and
is covered by passing tests. This is the same shape as the reachability gate's
subject — a control that is present, plumbed and believed, with a path that
never reaches it — so it gets the same treatment: enumerate mechanically, and
make every exception state its reason.

Being unpooled is not automatically wrong. A client held for an object's
lifetime is already doing the right thing, and some transports can't be shared.
Those are listed below with why; anything else is a new per-request client.

This logic used to not exist: the PR mutation job mutated the whole package
against the whole test suite, hit its 30-minute wall, and reported "cancelled"
on every PR that triggered it. Scoping is what makes the gate finishable, so
the scoping itself needs to be correct — and the one outcome that must never
happen silently is "fell back to the entire suite", which is the behavior that
caused the timeout.
